# Enhance Productivity with the ReactJS 25 + 5 Clock

Boost your productivity using the ReactJS 25 + 5 Clock, a simple yet effective web application that leverages the Pomodoro Technique to help you manage your work sessions and breaks efficiently. This project provides a user-friendly interface for setting customizable work and break durations, enabling you to maintain focus and productivity throughout your tasks.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros," and after completing four pomodoros, a longer break of 15-30 minutes is taken. This approach aims to improve concentration and productivity by breaking work into manageable, focused segments.

## Features of the ReactJS 25 + 5 Clock
